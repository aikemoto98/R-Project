# R Project

## Introduction

## Questions

## Retrieve dataset and define necessary functions

```{r}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

us_births_2016_2021 <- read_csv("data/us_births_2016_2021.csv")
View(us_births_2016_2021)
```

## Q1: How does the number of births change from 2016 to 2021? 

```{r}
#Group the years and number of births 
year_Numberofbirths <- us_births_2016_2021[c('Year','Number of Births')]

#Create new data frame for births and years 
yearbirthDF <- year_Numberofbirths %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(Births = sum(`Number of Births`))

#plot 
xYears <- c(yearbirthDF$Year)
yBirths <- c(yearbirthDF$Births)

ggplot(yearbirthDF, aes(x=xYears, y=yBirths)) +
   geom_line()+
   ggtitle("Total number of Births in the US from 2016 to 2021")+
   xlab("Year")+
   ylab("Total Number of Births")
   
```

## Q2: What is the correlation between Mother's Education Level and Age to Baby Weight?

```{r}
#Group the education level, code and age 
ageEduWeight <- us_births_2016_2021[c(6,8,9)]

ageEduDF <- ageEduWeight %>% 
  group_by(`Education Level Code`) %>%
  summarise(Age = sum(`Average Age of Mother (years)`)/n()) 

eduWeightDF <- ageEduWeight %>% 
  group_by(`Education Level Code`) %>%
  summarise(Weight = sum(`Average Birth Weight (g)`)/n()) 

#Make new dataframe to remove -9 level code
ageEdu_adj <- subset(ageEduDF, `Education Level Code`> 0)


xEdu <- c(ageEdu_adj$`Education Level Code`)
yAge <- c(ageEdu_adj$Age)


ggplot(ageEdu_adj, aes(x=xEdu, y=yAge,group=1)) +#add group = 1 to make work
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
    ggtitle("Mother's Education Level in Relation to Averaged Age")+
    xlab("Education Level of Code")+
    ylab("Average Age of Mother (years)")+
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(20, 40))
#    #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```
